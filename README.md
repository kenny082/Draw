# Drawing App - Inspired by MS Paint

A simple drawing application built using Python's `tkinter` library. 
This app allows users to draw using different types of pens, erase, and select colors from an RGB color wheel or hex codes. 

## Features

- **Basic Pen**: Draw with a solid color chosen via an RGB color picker or a hex code.
- **Rainbow Pen**: Create a rainbow effect while drawing.
- **Eraser Tool**: Erase parts of the drawing by "painting" with the background color.
- **Customizable Colors**: Choose from a wide range of colors using a color picker or input hex codes directly.
- **Resizing**: Resize various tools such as pen or eraser using a slider
- **Text Box**: Add a text box to write text
- **Clear Board** Clears the board and resets to white
## Usage

### Color Selection
- Use the "Colors" button to open the RGB color picker and select a color.
- Alternatively, enter a valid hex code (e.g., `#FF5733`) in the text field and click "Apply" to use that color.

### Pen Tools
- **Normal Pen**: The default pen for regular drawing.
- **Rainbow Pen**: Select this pen to draw with a rainbow effect. The color changes dynamically as you draw.
